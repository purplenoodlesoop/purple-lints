# purple_lints 📏

This monorepo contains repositories for `purple_lints` and `purple_metrics_lints` packages that are intended to be included in `analysis_options.yaml` file.

Both packages are built upon the thought of strictness. Strictness helps to unify the code, avoid runtime problems that are derived from type and mutability-related issues and avoid common pitfalls that developers that came from other languages can stumble upon.

This set of rules can be interpreted as too strict by some users, but learning to follow them will pay off. 

I use this set of rules on every one of my projects, as it is a base rule set in the purple_starter. It is battle-tested and proven to enforce a maintainable code style. Enjoy!
